# Phase 6 Admin API - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented 5 comprehensive admin API routes with full CRUD operations, proper authentication, validation, and error handling.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Core Utilities
- **`lib/utils/api.ts`** - Added `requireAdmin()` helper function
- **`lib/validations/api.ts`** - Added 10 Zod validation schemas for admin operations

### 2. API Routes (New)

| Route | File | Methods | Lines |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| `/api/admin/metrics` | `app/api/admin/metrics/route.ts` | GET | 216 |
| `/api/admin/analytics` | `app/api/admin/analytics/route.ts` | GET | 323 |
| `/api/admin/quotas` | `app/api/admin/quotas/route.ts` | GET, POST, PUT | 264 |
| `/api/admin/alerts` | `app/api/admin/alerts/route.ts` | GET, POST, PUT | 198 |
| `/api/admin/experiments` | `app/api/admin/experiments/route.ts` | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE | 371 |

**Total**: 1,372 lines of production-ready API code

## Key Features

### 1. System Metrics Dashboard (`/api/admin/metrics`)
- Search performance (latency P95/P99, throughput)
- Cache statistics (hit rate, layer distribution)
- Job queue status (pending, processing, failed)
- Quota usage across organizations
- Active alert incidents

### 2. Time-Series Analytics (`/api/admin/analytics`)
- Search trends over time
- Latency percentiles (P50, P75, P95, P99)
- Cache effectiveness trends
- Usage metrics by plan tier
- Configurable time ranges (24h, 7d, 30d, 90d)
- Configurable granularity (hour, day, week)

### 3. Quota Management (`/api/admin/quotas`)
- List all organizations with quota usage
- Filter by plan tier or near-limit status
- Update quota limits for organizations
- Reset usage counters
- Pagination support

### 4. Alert Management (`/api/admin/alerts`)
- List incidents with filtering (status, severity)
- Acknowledge alerts with notes
- Resolve alerts with notes
- Track alert handlers
- Summary statistics

### 5. A/B Testing (`/api/admin/experiments`)
- List experiments with performance metrics
- Create new experiments with variants
- Update experiment status and traffic allocation
- Delete experiments (draft/completed only)
- Automatic metric aggregation by variant

## Security Features

✅ **Role-Based Access Control**
- All routes require admin or owner role
- Enforced via `requireAdmin()` helper
- Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized users

✅ **Input Validation**
- All inputs validated with Zod schemas
- UUID format checking
- Enum validation
- Range validation

✅ **SQL Injection Protection**
- Supabase client with prepared statements
- No raw SQL with user input
- Parameterized queries throughout

✅ **Error Handling**
- Consistent error responses
- Request ID tracking
- Proper HTTP status codes
- No sensitive data leakage

## API Usage Examples

### Get System Metrics
```bash
GET /api/admin/metrics?timeRange=24h
```

### Get Time-Series Analytics
```bash
GET /api/admin/analytics?timeRange=7d&metric=searches&granularity=day
```

### List Organizations Near Quota Limits
```bash
GET /api/admin/quotas?nearLimit=true&limitThreshold=0.9
```

### Update Organization Quota
```bash
POST /api/admin/quotas
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "orgId": "uuid",
  "planTier": "professional",
  "searchesPerMonth": 10000,
  "storageGb": 100
}
```

### Acknowledge Alert
```bash
POST /api/admin/alerts/acknowledge
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "incidentId": "uuid",
  "notes": "Investigating root cause..."
}
```

### Create A/B Test Experiment
```bash
POST /api/admin/experiments
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Test New Reranking",
  "description": "Compare reranking algorithms",
  "feature": "reranking",
  "variants": [
    { "name": "control", "config": { "algorithm": "v1" } },
    { "name": "variant_a", "config": { "algorithm": "v2" } }
  ],
  "trafficAllocation": {
    "control": 0.5,
    "variant_a": 0.5
  }
}
```

## Design Decisions

### 1. Used `requireAdmin()` Helper
**Rationale**: Centralizes authorization logic, ensures consistency across routes

### 2. Supabase Admin Client
**Rationale**: Admin routes need system-wide access, bypassing RLS policies

### 3. Client-Side Time Bucketing
**Rationale**: More flexible than database views, easier to modify granularity
**Trade-off**: Performance could be improved with database aggregation for large datasets

### 4. Pagination on All List Endpoints
**Rationale**: Prevents overwhelming responses, supports large datasets

### 5. Embedded Related Data
**Rationale**: Reduces round trips, provides complete context in single response

## Performance Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Multiple database queries per request
- In-memory aggregation for time-series data
- Parallel fetching where possible (experiments)

### Recommended Optimizations
1. **Materialized Views**: Pre-aggregate metrics
2. **Redis Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data
3. **Database Aggregation**: Move time bucketing to PostgreSQL
4. **Query Optimization**: Add indexes for common filters

### Estimated Performance
- Metrics endpoint: ~200-500ms (depends on data volume)
- Analytics endpoint: ~500ms-2s (depends on time range)
- Quotas endpoint: ~100-300ms
- Alerts endpoint: ~100-200ms
- Experiments endpoint: ~300-800ms (parallel queries)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Needed
- `requireAdmin()` authorization logic
- All Zod validation schemas
- Time bucketing functions
- Metric calculation functions

### Integration Tests Needed
- Each route with valid admin user
- Each route with non-admin user (should fail)
- Pagination functionality
- Filtering functionality
- CRUD operations

### Load Tests Needed
- Metrics endpoint with 30d timeRange
- Analytics with high data volume
- Concurrent admin requests

## Known Limitations

1. **No Rate Limiting**: Admin routes need separate rate limits
2. **No Audit Logging**: Admin actions not explicitly logged to audit table
3. **No Bulk Operations**: One-by-one updates only
4. **No Export**: No CSV/Excel download functionality
5. **No Real-Time**: Metrics not streamed, polling required

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 7 Candidates
1. Real-time metrics streaming (WebSocket)
2. Custom metric definitions
3. Advanced alerting rules editor
4. Bulk operation endpoints
5. Data export functionality
6. Admin audit log table
7. Scheduled reports

### UI Components Needed
1. Admin dashboard (metrics visualization)
2. Analytics charts (recharts)
3. Quota management table
4. Alert incident list
5. Experiment A/B test results
