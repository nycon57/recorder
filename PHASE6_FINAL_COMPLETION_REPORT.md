## Known Issues & Limitations

### Non-Blocking Issues

1. **Materialized Views Require Manual Refresh**
   - Impact: Slight delay in popular queries data
   - Workaround: Set up pg_cron or manual refresh
   - Fix: Implement automatic refresh via pg_cron

2. **Connection Pooling Settings Require Restart**
   - Impact: ALTER SYSTEM settings need PostgreSQL restart
   - Workaround: Apply during maintenance window
   - Fix: Schedule database restart after migration

3. **Upstash Redis Not Included in Free Plan**
   - Impact: Requires paid Upstash account
   - Workaround: Falls back to memory-only cache
   - Fix: Budget for Upstash Redis ($10-50/month)

### No Critical Issues

All critical bugs and security vulnerabilities have been resolved.
