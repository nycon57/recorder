## Files Created

### Job Processing Infrastructure

#### `lib/workers/job-processor.ts`
Core job processing engine with:
- Continuous polling loop for pending jobs
- Parallel job processing with configurable batch size
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Graceful error handling and job state management
- Support for processing individual jobs by ID

**Key features**:
- Processes 10 jobs per batch by default
- 5-second poll interval (configurable)
- Max 3 retries with exponential backoff
- Automatic job status tracking (pending → processing → completed/failed)

#### `scripts/worker.ts`
CLI executable for running the job worker:
```bash
yarn worker          # Continuous mode
yarn worker:once     # Process one batch and exit
yarn worker:dev      # Watch mode for development
```

**Features**:
- Environment validation on startup
- Graceful shutdown handling (SIGINT/SIGTERM)
- One-shot mode for testing
- Process-specific jobs by ID: `yarn worker job:<job-id>`

### Job Handlers

#### `lib/workers/handlers/transcribe.ts`
OpenAI Whisper transcription handler:

**Process flow**:
1. Downloads video from Supabase Storage
2. Saves to temp file (handles WEBM format)
3. Calls OpenAI Whisper API with `verbose_json` format
4. Extracts word-level and segment-level timestamps
5. Saves transcript to database
6. Updates recording status to `transcribed`
7. Enqueues `doc_generate` job
8. Creates `recording.transcribed` event
9. Cleans up temp file

**Key features**:
- Automatic language detection (configurable)
- Word-level timestamp granularity
- Segment metadata preservation
- Robust error handling with status updates
- Automatic cleanup of temp files

#### `lib/workers/handlers/docify.ts`
GPT-5 Nano document generation handler:

**Process flow**:
1. Fetches transcript from database
2. Fetches recording metadata (title, description)
3. Builds context prompt with recording info
4. Calls GPT-5 Nano with specialized Docify prompt
5. Generates structured markdown document
6. Saves document with metadata
7. Updates recording status to `completed`
8. Enqueues `generate_embeddings` job
9. Creates `document.generated` event

**Key features**:
- Uses GPT-5 Nano for better performance
- Context-aware generation (includes title, duration, description)
- Markdown format output
- Usage tracking (token counts)
- Temperature 0.7 for balanced creativity

#### `lib/workers/handlers/embeddings.ts`
OpenAI text-embedding-3-small embedding generation handler:

**Process flow**:
1. Fetches transcript and document
2. Chunks transcript with timing metadata
3. Chunks document (markdown-aware if applicable)
4. Generates embeddings in batches (20 per batch)
5. Saves to `transcript_chunks` table with pgvector
6. Creates `embeddings.generated` event

**Key features**:
- Batch processing to respect rate limits
- 100ms delay between batches
- Preserves source metadata (transcript vs document)
- Timing information for transcript chunks
- Non-critical failure (doesn't affect recording status)

### Services

#### `lib/services/chunking.ts`
Intelligent text chunking service with multiple strategies:

**Functions**:
- `chunkText()` - General-purpose text chunking
  - Sentence-boundary aware
  - Sliding window with overlap
  - Token estimation (1 token ≈ 4 chars)
  - Configurable: maxTokens (500), overlapTokens (50), minTokens (100)

- `chunkTranscriptWithSegments()` - Transcript chunking with timing
  - Preserves segment metadata
  - Calculates start/end times for chunks
  - Enables time-based navigation

- `chunkMarkdown()` - Structure-preserving markdown chunking
  - Splits by headings first
  - Keeps sections together when possible
  - Falls back to sentence chunking for large sections

**Key features**:
- Overlap prevents context loss at boundaries
- Minimum chunk size prevents tiny fragments
- Character position tracking for highlighting
- Token estimation for embedding API compatibility

### Webhooks

#### `app/api/webhooks/route.ts`
Webhook handler for external service integrations:

**Security**:
- HMAC signature verification
- Configurable webhook secret
- Returns 401 for invalid signatures

**Supported events**:
- `transcription.completed` - External transcription service completion
- `transcription.failed` - External transcription service failure

**Features**:
- Routes events to appropriate handlers
- Updates database state
- Enqueues follow-up jobs
- Handles errors gracefully

### Status Progression

```
uploading → uploaded → transcribing → transcribed → doc_generating → completed
                                                                           ↓

```

### Job Queue Flow

```
Job Created (status: pending)
    ↓
Worker Picks Up (status: processing)
    ↓
    ├─ Success → status: completed
    │
    └─ Failure → Retry?
        ├─ Yes (attempt < 3) → status: pending (with run_after delay)
        │   └─ Exponential backoff: min(1000 * 2^attempt, 60000)ms
        │
        └─ No (attempt ≥ 3) → status: failed (with error message)
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Added to `.env.example`:
```bash
# Already present - used by Phase 3
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # For Whisper, GPT-5 Nano, Embeddings
OPENAI_ORG_ID=org-...           # Optional organization
WEBHOOK_SECRET=...              # For external webhook verification
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...  # For admin operations
```

### Package Scripts

Added to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "worker": "tsx scripts/worker.ts",           // Run worker continuously
    "worker:once": "tsx scripts/worker.ts once", // Process one batch and exit
    "worker:dev": "tsx watch scripts/worker.ts"  // Watch mode for development
  }
}
```

### Dependencies Added

- `tsx` (^4.7.0) - TypeScript execution for worker scripts

---

## Usage Examples

### Running the Worker

**Development** (with auto-reload):
```bash
yarn worker:dev
```

**Production** (continuous):
```bash
yarn worker
```

**One-time processing** (useful for testing):
```bash
yarn worker:once
```

**Process specific job**:
```bash
yarn worker job:01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
```

### Testing the Pipeline

1. **Upload a recording**:
```bash
# Via UI at http://localhost:3000/record
# Or via API:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/recordings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Test Recording"}'
```

2. **Finalize upload** (triggers transcription):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/recordings/{id}/finalize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"storagePath": "...", "sizeBytes": 1024}'
```

3. **Monitor job progress**:
```sql
-- Check pending jobs
SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Check processing jobs
SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE status = 'processing';

-- Check failed jobs
SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE status = 'failed';
```

4. **Check recording status**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/recordings/{id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

---

## Error Handling

### Job Retry Logic

- **Attempt 1**: Immediate retry (0ms delay)
- **Attempt 2**: 2-second delay
- **Attempt 3**: 4-second delay
- **After 3 attempts**: Job marked as `failed`

### Recording Status on Error

If any job fails after max retries:
```typescript
recording.status = 'error'
recording.metadata.error = 'Error message here'
```

### Error Recovery

**Manual retry**:
```sql
-- Reset failed job to pending
UPDATE jobs
SET status = 'pending', attempt_count = 0, run_after = NOW()
WHERE id = '<job-id>';
```

**Process specific job**:
```bash
yarn worker job:<job-id>
```

## Performance Considerations

### Rate Limits

**OpenAI API**:
- Whisper: ~50 requests/minute
- GPT-5 Nano: ~500 requests/minute (tier dependent)
- Embeddings: ~3000 requests/minute

**Current implementation**:
- Processes jobs sequentially (no parallel handler execution)
- Embedding batches: 20 chunks per API call
- 100ms delay between embedding batches
- Configurable poll interval (5s default)

### Scaling Strategies

**Horizontal scaling**:
```bash
# Run multiple worker instances
pm2 start scripts/worker.ts -i 4  # 4 instances
```

**Vertical scaling**:
- Increase `batchSize` for more jobs per cycle
- Decrease `pollInterval` for faster pickup
- Increase embedding `BATCH_SIZE` (max 2048 per API call)

**Database optimization**:
- Jobs table indexed on `status` and `run_after`
- pgvector uses IVFFlat index for fast similarity search
- Partition jobs table by `created_at` for large volumes

## Known Issues & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **Transcription format**: Only supports WEBM input (from browser recording)
   - **Solution**: Add format detection and conversion via FFMPEG

2. **Language detection**: Hardcoded to 'en'
   - **Solution**: Make configurable per-recording or auto-detect

3. **No progress updates**: User doesn't see real-time progress
   - **Solution**: WebSocket or SSE for live status updates (Phase 5+)

4. **Single worker instance**: No distributed job processing
   - **Solution**: Add Redis for distributed locking (Upstash already configured)

5. **No job prioritization**: All jobs processed FIFO
   - **Solution**: Add priority field to jobs table

6. **Embedding model fixed**: Uses text-embedding-3-small (older model)
   - **Solution**: Support for `text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large`

### Enhancements for Future Phases

- **Job monitoring dashboard** (Phase 6)
- **Dead letter queue** for permanently failed jobs
- **Job scheduling** (cron-like syntax for recurring tasks)
- **Webhook retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Transcript editing** and re-generation
- **Custom chunking strategies** per recording type
- **Multi-language support** for Whisper
- **PII redaction** in transcripts (feature flag exists)

---

## Integration Points

### Phase 2 Integration
- Recording finalize API creates transcription jobs
- Recording status displayed in dashboard
- Recording detail page shows processing state

### Phase 4 Integration (Next)
- Vector search uses `transcript_chunks` embeddings
- Semantic search API queries pgvector
- Search results include chunk metadata (timestamps, source)

### Phase 5 Integration (Future)
- RAG assistant retrieves relevant chunks
