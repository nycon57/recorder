## 🔧 Development Tips

### Running Migrations
```bash
# Using Supabase CLI (recommended)
supabase db push

# Or manually copy SQL from migrations folder
```

### Type Generation
```bash
# Generate TypeScript types from Supabase
supabase gen types typescript --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID > lib/types/supabase.ts
```

### Testing API Endpoints
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Create recording (requires auth)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/recordings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLERK_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"title": "Test Recording"}'
```

## 📝 Notes

- The existing recording components from the Vite app are still in `/src` directory
- These need to be migrated to `/app` and converted to Next.js client components
- Original FFMPEG.wasm functionality will be preserved
- All new features are additive - original recorder functionality will remain

## 🆘 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Ensure database migrations have run successfully
3. Verify Clerk organization feature is enabled
4. Check Supabase project is active and pgvector is enabled
5. Review console logs for error messages
