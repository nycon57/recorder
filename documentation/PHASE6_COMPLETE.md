## Overview

Phase 6 implements sharing and collaboration features, allowing users to share recordings and conversations publicly or with password protection.

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Sharing System** - Public and password-protected links
2. **Share API** - Create, list, update, and delete shares
3. **Public Share Pages** - View shared content without authentication
4. **Password Protection** - Secure shares with bcrypt hashing
5. **View Tracking** - Count and limit views
6. **Expiration** - Time-limited shares

- `updateShare()` - Update share settings

**Features**:
- Unique share IDs (base64url encoded, 22 chars)
- bcrypt password hashing
- Expiration validation
- Max views enforcement
- Organization scoping

### API Routes

#### `app/api/share/route.ts`
**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/share` - Create share link
- `GET /api/share?resourceType=X&resourceId=Y` - List shares

#### `app/api/share/[id]/route.ts`
**Endpoints**:
- `DELETE /api/share/:id` - Delete share
- `PATCH /api/share/:id` - Update share settings

### Public Pages

#### `app/s/[shareId]/page.tsx`
Public share viewer with:
- Password form for protected shares
- Expiration handling
- Max views handling
- View count incrementing
- Shared recording display
- Shared conversation display

## Share Link Format

**URL Structure**:
```
https://yourdomain.com/s/{shareId}
```

**Example**:
```
https://record.app/s/a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1
```

**With Password** (query param):
```
https://record.app/s/a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1?password=secret123
```

---

## Share Types

### Public Share
- No password required
- Anyone with link can access
- Optional expiration
- Optional view limit

### Password-Protected Share
- Requires password for access
- Password stored as bcrypt hash
- Same expiration/view limit options
- Password shown once on creation

---

## Database Schema

Uses `shares` table from Phase 1:

```sql
CREATE TABLE shares (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  share_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,           -- Public share identifier
  resource_type TEXT NOT NULL,              -- 'recording' or 'conversation'
  resource_id UUID NOT NULL,
  org_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id),
  share_type TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- 'public' or 'password'
  password_hash TEXT,                       -- bcrypt hash
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  view_count INT DEFAULT 0,
  max_views INT,
  created_by TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Create Public Share

```bash
curl -X POST /api/share \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resourceType": "recording",
    "resourceId": "abc-123",
    "shareType": "public",
    "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }'
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "share": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "shareId": "a1b2c3d4...",
      "url": "https://app.com/s/a1b2c3d4...",
      "shareType": "public",
      "expiresAt": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",
      "viewCount": 0
    }
  }
}
```

### Create Password-Protected Share

```bash
curl -X POST /api/share \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "resourceType": "conversation",
    "resourceId": "xyz-789",
    "shareType": "password",
    "password": "secret123",
    "maxViews": 100
  }'
```

## Security Features

### Password Protection
- bcrypt hashing with salt rounds = 10
- Passwords never stored in plaintext
- Password verification on access

### Expiration
- Automatic validation on access
- Cannot access expired shares
- Configurable per share

### View Limits
- Tracks view count
- Enforces maximum views
- Useful for limited releases

### Organization Scoping
- Shares belong to organizations
- Only org members can create/delete
- Public access for viewing only

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.3",
    "resend": "^3.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/bcryptjs": "^2.4.6"
  }
}
```

## Phase 6 Status

âœ… **Sharing**: Fully implemented
âœ… **API**: Complete
âœ… **Security**: Password hashing, expiration, view limits
âœ… **Public Access**: Works without authentication

**Not Implemented** (intentionally simplified):
- Notification system (documented but not required for MVP)
- Email sharing invitations
- Social media previews
- Share analytics dashboard

These features can be added in future iterations if needed.
