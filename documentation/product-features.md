Product Features and Rationale

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the SaaS app’s features, organized by domain area. For each feature or group of features, we describe what it is, why it exists (rationale), and how users are expected to interact with it. This helps engineers and AI agents understand the scope of the product and the reasoning behind design decisions.

Recording & Capture Features

1. Screen and Camera Recording (Browser-Based):
Feature: Users can record their screen (specific application or entire desktop) along with their webcam and microphone, directly from the browser. The UI allows choosing which screen or window to capture and toggling the webcam on/off (webcam feed appears as a small overlay, e.g. picture-in-picture style). The user can start, pause, resume, and stop the recording.
Rationale: The core of our product is capturing expert knowledge in an easy way. Screen recording with voice (and optional face video) lets an expert show and tell a process or concept without writing anything. Including the camera personalizes the content, which can aid engagement and clarity. Browser-based capture means no installs required, lowering the barrier to usage.
Expected Behavior: The user clicks “New Recording” in the app, is prompted by the browser to select what to share (screen) and to allow camera/mic. Once granted, they see a recording toolbar (e.g., a small control panel with a timer, pause/stop buttons). They carry out their demonstration or explanation while the app records. They might pause if needed (e.g., to switch a window or take a break) and then resume. On clicking stop, the recording finalizes: the user is then taken to the next step (upload or processing screen). The video data is uploaded in the background (if not already during recording) and the user is informed that transcription is in progress.

2. Live Notes Bookmarking (Planned):
Feature: (Planned for future) During recording, the user can hit a “bookmark” hotkey or button to mark important moments. They might also be able to type a quick note or label for that bookmark.
Rationale: This helps the expert highlight key points or sections while recording, which can later be used to structure the document or allow viewers to jump to that point. It bridges the gap between freeform recording and structured output by letting the expert impose some structure on the fly if they want.
Expected Behavior: While recording, if the user hits (for example) the “B” key or clicks a “Add Marker” button, the app records the current timestamp and possibly opens a small text input for a note. The expert can jot “Important tip here” or similar. These markers are saved and will appear on the timeline for reference once the recording is processed (e.g., on the video player, and in the transcript as highlighted lines). This feature would be optional and introduced once basic flow is stable.

3. Multi-Stream Capture Composition:
Feature: The app captures multiple streams (screen, webcam, audio) and merges them into one recording. We implement this by drawing video streams into a single canvas or combining tracks so the output is a single file with all streams.
Rationale: This is largely a behind-the-scenes feature, but it ensures the end video is convenient (one file) and the webcam overlay is burned into the video. It avoids having to manage separate files for screen and camera. For the user, it just works seamlessly – they see their face in the corner of the recording as it’s happening and in the final playback.
Expected Behavior: The user doesn’t directly interact with this logic. They simply choose to record with camera on, and the system handles merging. From an engineering perspective, we expect a slight performance cost on the client (due to canvas compositing) and we must manage that (e.g., rendering at a reasonable resolution/frame rate to balance quality and performance). The end result should be a standard format video (e.g., webm with VP8/VP9 + Vorbis if using Chrome’s default, or mp4/H.264 if using certain browsers) that can be played back easily in the app.

4. Re-record and Editing (Basic):
Feature: If a user is not satisfied with a recording, they can discard it and record again. After stopping a recording, before they leave the recording page, we may offer a preview and a “Retake” option. Basic editing (like trimming the start/end) might be offered after recording.
Rationale: Experts may make mistakes or want a do-over. Providing a quick way to retry keeps the user from getting frustrated with a one-take outcome. Trimming helps remove idle time at start or end (like “Oh is this recording? … Ok let’s start.” moments).
Expected Behavior: After stopping, the video might be shown with a “Retake Recording” button. If clicked, the current recording is scrapped (not uploaded) and the user can immediately start a new one. For trimming, a simple slider UI to cut off a few seconds from start or finish can be presented. The user adjusts, then confirms. Trimming would be done either in browser (if feasible for small trims using MediaRecorder’s data) or on server after upload.

These recording features focus on making capture easy and high-quality. The rationale is always to minimize friction for the expert while ensuring the output contains all needed context (screen + voice + face).

Transcription Features

1. Automatic Speech-to-Text Transcription:
Feature: Once a recording is uploaded, the audio track is automatically transcribed to text (via our transcription service). This produces a full transcript of everything said in the video.
Rationale: The transcript is the foundation for search, document generation, and accessibility. Having text means the content is easily skimmable and indexable. Automated transcription saves the user from ever having to manually transcribe or jot notes. It’s crucial for speed and for the subsequent AI processing.
Expected Behavior: The user doesn’t have to click anything – after recording, they see a status like “Transcribing audio…”. The system sends the audio for transcription. In a few minutes (depending on length), the transcript is returned. The user might get a notification (“Transcript ready!”). When they open the recording’s page, they see the transcript text aligned with the video (e.g., displayed as an interactive transcript where clicking a line jumps the video to that point, if possible). The transcript accuracy is high but not perfect, so some words might be wrong – the user can later edit if needed (see next feature).

2. Transcript Editing & Annotation:
Feature: Users can edit the transcript text in the app. This is like a lightweight text editor on the transcript. They can correct any transcription errors, redact sensitive info, or annotate sections. Edits do not change the original video/audio, just the text.
Rationale: No transcription is 100% perfect, especially with domain-specific terms or names. Allowing edits means the user can ensure the transcript’s accuracy and usefulness. Annotations (like adding a comment or highlighting an important sentence) can help later when generating the doc or for readers of the transcript. Essentially, it gives some control back to the user to refine the AI output.
Expected Behavior: Once the transcript is available, in the recording detail page the user can click into the transcript text and type to change it (inline editing). We might implement this with a rich text component. Edits are autosaved (or saved with a button). Perhaps a “Mark as final” toggle to indicate they’ve reviewed it. If the user changes wording significantly, we don’t re-run the AI processing automatically (to avoid confusion), but we might prompt “If you edited a lot, consider regenerating the summary doc.” The user can also highlight text and leave a comment (if we support comments) or mark a segment as important for their own reference.

3. Timestamp Alignment and Playback Sync:
Feature: The transcript is time-aligned with the video. Each sentence or word knows the timestamp in the video. This allows features like: clicking a transcript line jumps the video, and as the video plays, the current spoken text is highlighted in the transcript.
Rationale: This improves user experience for consuming the content. Someone might prefer reading but want to hear a certain part – they can click the text to play that segment. Or as they watch the video, they can follow along in text (useful if audio quality isn’t perfect or for accessibility). It also helps the AI assistant later to reference “at 5:32, the user explained X”.
Expected Behavior: The transcription service we use (like Whisper) may provide word-level or sentence-level timestamps. We store these. In the frontend, we use them to map video currentTime to transcript position. The user sees a subtle highlight following along the transcript. They can scroll through text and double-click a sentence to play from there. This requires a bit of UI synchronization logic. For editing, if the user edits text, we might maintain the original timings for reference (unless re-aligned later).

4. Multi-language Support:
Feature: The transcription supports multiple languages (e.g., if the expert speaks in Spanish or French, we can still transcribe, possibly auto-detected or by user selection).
Rationale: Many teams are multilingual. Supporting at least major languages out-of-the-box broadens our market and makes the tool useful in non-English contexts. Even if our UI is English-only initially, the content captured can be other languages.
Expected Behavior: Ideally the transcription API auto-detects language. If not, we might let the user specify the spoken language before recording or before transcription. The rest of the flow remains the same. The generated document and AI assistant would then operate in that language for that piece of content. (We’d have to prompt the LLM accordingly to output in the content’s language). We expect initial use mostly in English, but this feature ensures we’re not hardwired to English transcripts.

5. Speaker Identification (if needed):
Feature: (If multiple speakers present) Identify speakers in the transcript (e.g., Speaker 1 vs Speaker 2), such as if an expert and a colleague were both speaking in a recorded Zoom call.
Rationale: If our use-case expands to recording meetings or interviews, distinguishing speakers is important for readability. It might not be heavily used in single-expert monologue scenarios, but it’s a nice capability if two voices are present.
Expected Behavior: The transcript service might label speakers if it has that feature (some APIs do). Otherwise, we likely won’t implement this in early version. If implemented, the transcript would show e.g. “Alice: … Bob: …” for different voices. The user could also edit these labels (because detection isn’t always accurate). This feature is lower priority unless we see users recording dialogues often.

Transcription features ensure that once the video is recorded, we have a text version that’s accurate and user-refined. The rationale behind each is to maximize the utility of the transcript: it should be correct, easy to navigate, and ready for the next steps (document generation and search).

Document Generation (“Docify”) Features

1. Automated Structured Document Creation:
Feature: After transcription (and optionally after user edits), the system automatically generates a structured document from the transcript. This can be a Markdown or HTML document with sections, headings, bullet points, code blocks (if code was mentioned), and other formatting to make it readable and structured.
Rationale: A raw transcript is often a verbatim dump – hard to read and not well-organized. The goal of “Docify” is to turn that into something resembling a user manual, guide, or article that captures the essence of what was taught in the video. This saves huge time for the expert, who would otherwise have to manually write documentation. It also makes the content more consumable for others (someone can read the summary doc instead of watching a long video).
Expected Behavior: Once the transcript is ready, the user sees a status like “Generating document…”. We prompt an LLM in the backend with the transcript (or segmented parts of it) to create an organized doc. The result is stored and displayed perhaps alongside the transcript. For example, if the expert recorded a how-to on configuring a server, the structured doc might come out with an introduction, a list of steps, code blocks for commands said, and a conclusion. The user can open the “Document” tab on the recording page and see this formatted output. The first version is fully AI-generated.

2. Document Editing & Versioning:
Feature: Users can edit the generated document to refine or add missing details. The document is stored so that further changes by the AI won’t override user edits without consent. Potentially, we keep versions (initial AI version, and then user’s edits as the current version).
Rationale: The AI does heavy lifting, but the expert might want to tweak phrasing, fix any mistakes the AI made, or add extra context. Editing capability ensures the final document can meet high standards of accuracy and style that the organization may require. Versioning is important so that if the user regenerates the doc later (say after editing transcript or after an improved model), we don’t silently lose their manual edits.
Expected Behavior: In the UI, the doc appears as rich text (or Markdown editor). The user can click “Edit” which turns it into an editable area. They can make changes (formatting toolbar for basic styles, or directly editing Markdown). We might auto-save changes or have a save button. The system could highlight which parts were AI-generated vs edited by the user for clarity. If we support version history, a user could revert to the AI original or see changes. Likely we start simpler: one editable version that once edited, is considered the source of truth unless the user deliberately regenerates.

3. Regeneration Options (Docify):
Feature: The user can trigger regenerating the document. Options might include “Regenerate full document” (which reruns the AI on the latest transcript) or future enhancements like “Summarize to X length” or “Focus on bullet points”.
Rationale: AI generation might not get it perfect on first try, or the user may update the transcript and want a new doc reflecting changes. They might also want different formats (maybe one version as a quick summary, another as a detailed guide). Providing regeneration allows for iteration. It’s also a way to incorporate improvements (if our prompts or model improve later, the user can re-run to get a better structured doc).
Expected Behavior: A “Regenerate Document” button is present near the doc. Possibly a dropdown with options like “Regenerate (overwrite)” or “Generate new version”. If clicked, we warn if it will overwrite their edits. Perhaps we let them generate a second version for comparison. The user waits a short time as the AI runs again. The new output is then displayed. If we see common desires (like “make it more concise” or “include code examples”), we could add toggles or prompt enhancements for those, but initially it’s just a re-run of the same process.

4. Document Templates (Future):
Feature: (Planned) Ability to choose a style or template for the document. For example: “Tutorial style” vs “Summary memo” vs “Slide deck outline”. This would guide the AI generation to different formats.
Rationale: Different use cases might want the output in different forms. One might want a step-by-step tutorial, another might want a one-page executive summary of a talk. By allowing template choices, we cater to more needs and make the feature more flexible. This is a future idea once we have baseline doc generation working reliably.
Expected Behavior: The user might see a dropdown or set of buttons before generation like “Generate as: [Guide/Documentation] [Summary] [Q&A Handbook]”. Selecting one changes the prompt for the AI. The output is then tailored. The user can regenerate with different templates to see which they prefer. For initial version, we likely default to a general guide format.

5. Publishing/Exporting Documents:
Feature: Users can export or share the structured document. Export formats might include PDF, Word, or a Markdown download. We may also have a “Publish to knowledge base” toggle that makes the doc accessible via a public (or internal) URL.
Rationale: Once the doc is created and edited, it becomes a valuable knowledge asset. Users will want to share it – maybe put it on an internal wiki, send to a colleague, or include in a report. Exporting makes our product’s output portable (not locking content inside). Publishing internally (within the app) with a link allows quick sharing without the friction of copy-paste.
Expected Behavior: On the doc page, options like “Download Markdown” or “Export PDF” will be available. We’ll use a Markdown-to-PDF library or similar for that. For publishing, if enabled, we generate a unique URL (maybe our site has a /pub/doc/<id> route) that anyone with the link can view (read-only). The user can send this link to others. They can also revoke/unpublish if needed. This essentially turns the doc into a mini web page, possibly including the video or transcript if we choose. If we support public publish, we’ll ensure the user understands what data becomes public (maybe limit to within org or password-protect initially). This drives adoption too – recipients of the shared content may become interested in the platform.

The document generation features are aimed at maximizing the usefulness of the captured knowledge. The rationale is always that the expert’s effort of recording should multiply into various forms of knowledge with minimal additional work. We want the structured docs to be as good as something a human would author given the transcript, and give the user control to refine it. Over time, these docs can form a knowledge repository for the team.

Vector Search & AI Assistant Features

1. Semantic Search (Vector Search):
Feature: Users can search their content semantically by asking questions or entering keywords in natural language. The system will find relevant parts of any transcript or document, even if the exact keywords differ. This is powered by vector similarity matching of embeddings.
Rationale: Traditional keyword search is limited – users might not recall exact phrasing used in a video. Semantic search understands the query’s meaning and finds related information in the transcripts/docs. This is crucial because it transforms the collection of videos/documents into a queryable knowledge base. It addresses the core pain: “Somewhere in all these recordings, the answer exists – how do I find it quickly?”
Expected Behavior: In the dashboard or a dedicated “Assistant” page, there’s a search bar or chat box. If the user types a query like “How do I reset the database connection?”, the system will:
	•	Convert the query to an embedding,
	•	Search the vector index for the closest matches (limited to that user’s/org’s data).
	•	Return a list of results: possibly specific segments of transcripts or docs that are relevant. We might show a snippet of the text and which recording it’s from, with a link.
For a better UX, this is integrated with the AI Q&A (next feature), but even a direct search result list is useful. The expected result is that even if the transcript said “restart the DB connection pool” and user asked “reset database connection”, the semantic search can match those as similar concepts.

2. AI Q&A Assistant (Chatbot):
Feature: A conversational assistant that can answer questions by drawing from the recorded knowledge. The user interacts in a chat interface, asking something like “What steps did Jane mention for configuring the firewall?” The AI then finds relevant context from the transcripts/docs and formulates an answer, often with references (like “According to Jane’s recording on Network Setup, the steps are X, Y”).
Rationale: This is a marquee feature that makes the knowledge easily accessible to non-recorders. Team members who didn’t watch a video can still ask questions and get answers as if they consulted the expert. It leverages the combination of transcripts + vector search + LLM to provide a natural, quick way to get information. This drives value for consumers of the content, not just the creators.
Expected Behavior: The assistant is available in a chat UI (perhaps on its own page or as a sidebar in the recording detail page for context-specific Q&A). The user asks a question in text. The backend uses a retrieval augmented generation approach:
	•	It vector-searches the query against our embeddings (filtering to the current org’s data).
	•	It takes the top relevant excerpts (maybe sentences or paragraphs from transcripts/docs).
	•	It feeds those, along with the question, into an LLM (OpenAI GPT-5 Nano/3.5) to get a composed answer.
	•	The answer is then streamed to the UI (token by token, for a nice experience). The answer might say, “To configure the firewall, you need to open the settings, go to Security > Firewall, then add a new rule…” with a citation or reference to the source video/doc (which we can hyperlink).
The user can then ask a follow-up question, and the assistant will keep the context (we may maintain a short dialogue memory plus always refer back to the knowledge base for each query). The chat feels like talking to a knowledgeable colleague who has watched all the videos.

3. Contextual Assistant (within Recording):
Feature: When viewing a specific recording’s page, the AI assistant can answer questions scoped to that recording. For example, on a video page, a user might ask “What were the key takeaways here?” and the assistant will summarize or answer based only on that video’s content.
Rationale: Sometimes a user is consuming one piece of content and wants a quick clarification or summary without searching the whole org database. A context-limited assistant improves the experience of that single recording. It’s like an AI that you can ask “explain this differently” or “what did they mean by X in this video?”
Expected Behavior: On the recording detail page, we might have a Q&A box pre-loaded with that recording’s context. The system knows to filter vector search to that recording or even just use the transcript directly for answers. If a user asks a question, the assistant can even quote the transcript from earlier in the video. We expect this to be used for clarifications (“When in the video did they mention database? – Answer: around 12:45 mark, they said ‘…’”) or summarization (“Summarize this video – Answer: [summary]”). This is basically the same mechanism as global assistant but with a filter = current recording only, and possibly some UX cues that it’s in “local mode”.

4. Multi-Document Query (Cross-video):
Feature: The assistant can combine information from multiple recordings/documents to answer a question.
Rationale: Often knowledge is distributed. One video might cover A, another B, but a question might need both. Our AI should be able to retrieve bits from multiple sources. E.g., “How do I set up the database and connect it to the server?” – maybe one recording was about database setup, another about server config. The assistant should pull from both to give a complete answer.
Expected Behavior: When the user asks a broad question in the global assistant, the vector search likely returns top snippets that could be from different recordings. The LLM will see all those and try to synthesize. We should present the answer with references to each source snippet (e.g., “From Database Setup video: …; and in Server Config doc: …”). The user might get an answer that merges knowledge, which is powerful. We have to ensure the context we give the LLM isn’t too large (so we might limit to top 3-5 relevant chunks for now). If needed, user can clarify or follow up.

5. Filters and Namespace Isolation:
Feature: Users (especially org admins) can restrict searches to certain subsets of content using filters. For instance, filter by tag or by a specific project. Additionally, each organization’s data is isolated – the assistant will never use data from another org.
Rationale: Privacy and relevance: We must guarantee that one company’s query doesn’t leak answers from another’s data. That’s handled by namespace isolation at the database level and in any vector index (each org is a separate namespace). Filters allow the user more control, e.g., “Search only in Finance videos” if they categorize content. This can improve result precision especially as the knowledge base grows.
Expected Behavior: By default, the assistant implicitly filters to the current organization (we include org_id in every query to the vector DB). If we use Pinecone later, we use separate Pinecone namespaces or metadata like org_id to ensure isolation. The user might see an UI element to refine search scope: maybe a dropdown of tags or a checkbox “This folder only”. Implementing tagging/categorization might be a later feature, but we design the search to handle a filter parameter. The assistant should respect it (only pass vectors from allowed set). In a multi-org scenario, if the user switches org context, the assistant context switches too (e.g., only that org’s data is loaded). Essentially, each org’s data is siloed by design.

6. Proactive Suggestions:
Feature: (Future idea) The assistant can proactively suggest answers or content as the user types a query (auto-complete with knowledge) or highlight new content (“You have a new recording about X, ask me about it!”).
Rationale: This isn’t core, but could enhance UX by making the system feel intelligent and helpful. For instance, if a user just uploaded a video about “Onboarding process”, when they go to the assistant, it might suggest “New: Onboarding process – ask me something like ‘How do I create a new account?’” This drives engagement with the new content. Auto-complete could help formulate better queries or discover terminology that exists in the content.
Expected Behavior: We would need to gather frequent queries or use an index of terms from transcripts to implement suggestions. This is down the line. Initially, we might simply show recent recordings or popular questions on the assistant page as static suggestions.

The vector search and assistant features are all about unlocking the knowledge captured in recordings and documents. The rationale is to enable users (especially those who didn’t create the content) to get answers quickly without wading through hours of video. It turns our platform from just a repository of info into an active knowledge provider. By grouping these features, we see that we need robust backend support (vector indexes, isolation by org, integration with LLMs) and a smooth UI for asking questions and viewing answers.

Collaboration & Organization Features

1. Multi-Organization (Tenant) Support:
Feature: The platform supports multiple organizations, meaning a user can belong to one or more org workspaces. Each organization has its own separate set of recordings, docs, and members. Users can switch between orgs if they belong to several (e.g., a contractor might work with two companies, each with their own knowledge base).
Rationale: This is crucial for B2B SaaS – each customer (company/team) gets a private space. It ensures data separation (security) and also reflects real-world use: companies don’t want their data mingled. For our internal use, it also allows development/test orgs separate from live. Clerk’s organization feature gives us much of this out-of-the-box.
Expected Behavior: When a user signs up, they might create an organization (e.g., “Acme Corp”) or join an existing one via an invite. In the UI, if a user has access to multiple orgs, a selector (perhaps a dropdown with org name) is available in the header. Switching orgs changes all the content to that context (the URL might even include an org slug if we implement that, e.g., acme.app.com or /org/acme/…). Each org has its own admin(s) who can manage membership. We store org_id with every relevant record to enforce backend isolation. The user’s role in the org (admin or member) dictates what they can do (see roles below).

2. Roles and Permissions:
Feature: Role-based access control within an organization. At minimum, roles like Admin and Member exist. Admins can invite/remove users, change settings, and access all recordings. Members (non-admin) can create recordings and view the org’s recordings, but maybe cannot delete others’ content or manage the team. Possibly a Viewer role could be considered (view content but not create).
Rationale: Not all users are equal in a team setting. We want to prevent accidents (only admins delete or publish content globally) and support enterprise needs (maybe only certain people can manage billing). Clerk Organizations come with a default role set which we can use or extend. This ensures security (e.g., a member shouldn’t access billing or remove someone).
Expected Behavior: The system likely uses Clerk’s org roles: e.g., “basic_member” vs “admin” (Clerk allows custom role names). In the UI, admin-only features (like the Settings -> Organization page, or deleting a recording not your own) are only shown if your role is admin. On the backend, any admin-level action double-checks the user’s role. We might also restrict some features in future (like perhaps only an admin can publish a document publicly). Invitations by admin default new users to member role. If needed, roles can be changed in an org settings screen.

3. Collaboration on Content:
Feature: Multiple users in the same org can collaborate on the knowledge. This includes:
	•	Viewing each other’s recordings and documents (by default, all content in an org is shared with all members, unless marked private).
	•	Possibly co-editing or commenting on transcripts/docs.
	•	Leaving comments or questions on a recording (outside of the AI assistant context, a manual comment feature).
Rationale: Since this is aimed at teams, the content created by one expert should benefit others. Collaboration features ensure knowledge flows. Commenting is useful if a viewer has a question or suggestion – it’s like adding human feedback separate from the AI. Co-editing might be useful if, say, an assistant wants to clean up the boss’s transcript for them.
Expected Behavior: By default, when Alice in org Acme records something, Bob (also in Acme) can see it on the dashboard. He can click it, watch, read transcript, etc. If Bob has a question, he could either use the AI assistant or leave a comment that Alice gets notified about (“What did you mean by step 3 here?”). For editing, if we allow it, maybe admins can edit any doc to polish it (with a history of who changed what ideally). Comments would appear in a sidebar or inline, tagged with user and timestamp. This is akin to Google Docs comments or YouTube video comments at timestamps. It’s a complex feature so maybe not in MVP, but conceptually we plan to support team collaboration in refining content.

4. Sharing Outside Organization:
Feature: Ability to share content with people outside the org. This could be a public share link for a document or a video, with optional password protection. Or an “external user” concept where you invite someone to view a specific item (without full org access).
Rationale: Sometimes an expert’s recording might be useful to clients or a broader community. While our focus is internal knowledge, enabling controlled external sharing increases flexibility. It could also serve as a marketing vector (a public doc might show “Created by DocuVision” branding, attracting new users).
Expected Behavior: On a recording or doc, an owner or admin could toggle “Share publicly” which creates a unique URL. Anyone with that URL can view the document (and maybe play the video) but not see any other content. They won’t have access to the AI assistant unless we allow a limited Q&A on that single content (interesting idea but complicated licensing wise if they aren’t a user). For more controlled sharing, we might allow adding a specific user by email with view-only rights to a particular item (which would send them an invite link). Initially, likely just a simple public link with a disclaimer “Anyone with link can view – use for external sharing carefully.” When active, maybe show a badge “Public” on that item. The system logs or counts public views so we know usage.

5. Notifications:
Feature: Notify users about relevant events, e.g., “Your transcription is complete”, “John uploaded a new recording: ‘Onboarding 101’”, “Jane commented on ‘Server Setup’”. Notifications can be in-app (badge or notification center) and optionally email.
Rationale: Keeps users engaged and informed. If a process finishes (transcription/doc ready), the user should know without constantly checking. Team members might want to know when new knowledge is added. Comments or mentions require notifying the involved users to prompt a response. Timely notifications improve collaboration and make the app feel responsive.
Expected Behavior: We’ll implement a lightweight notification system. For example, when a pipeline finishes generating a doc, we create a notification in our DB for the owner. If they’re online, maybe a toast popup says “Document ready to view”. If not, an email could be sent saying “Your recording ‘XYZ’ has been processed – click here to view the results.” For team events, perhaps a daily or weekly summary email might be less intrusive (“5 new recordings were added in your org this week”). In-app, an icon (bell) could show unread notifications. Users can adjust what they get notified about via settings (especially for emails). We may utilize Clerk’s built-in notification support if available, or implement our own via a background job sending through an email API.

6. Billing & Usage (Admin Feature):
Feature: Organization admins can view usage stats (minutes of video transcribed, number of docs, AI query count) and manage their subscription (upgrade/downgrade, payment info) via a Billing page.
Rationale: Although not a direct “product feature” for end users, this is important for transparency and for upselling. Admins should know if they are nearing limits (if any) and have a one-click way to handle billing. This is part of product polish that reduces friction in the purchasing process.
Expected Behavior: In settings, Billing section shows current plan, what that plan includes (e.g., “Up to 5 hours of video per month, 100 AI queries/day”) and current usage (“This month: 4h video, 80 queries”). If they are near or over limits, it could highlight that. A “Manage Subscription” button likely redirects to Stripe Customer Portal for self-service (update card, change plan, etc.). We handle provisioning via Stripe webhooks to update the plan in our DB. This feature ensures no surprises and gives control to the paying customer (the admin).

Each of these collaboration and org features is about making the product fit in a team/enterprise environment. The rationale is to move from a single-user tool to a multi-user knowledge hub. Users should feel it’s a shared space where knowledge is contributed and utilized together, under proper access controls. For engineers, these features imply additional considerations like permission checks in API routes (see authentication.md and api-spec.md for enforcement), and designing the data model for multi-tenancy (see database-schema.md).

In summary, our product features span from capturing information (recordings) to processing it (transcripts, docs) to retrieving it (search/assistant) and finally to enabling a team to effectively use it together (collaboration, sharing). The rationale behind this comprehensive feature set is to create a knowledge loop: capture tacit knowledge easily and turn it into explicit knowledge that can be disseminated and queried. We expect users to primarily record and consume content, while the AI/automation fills the gap of organizing and extracting value from that content. Over time, we will refine each feature based on feedback, but this outline serves as a blueprint for what the product does and why each part matters.
