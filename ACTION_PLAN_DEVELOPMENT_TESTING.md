  - [ ] Validate API key → Verify bcrypt.compare() works
  - [ ] Test timing attack resistance → Measure response times
  - [ ] Test expired keys → Should be rejected
  - [ ] Test revoked keys → Should be rejected

- [ ] **RLS Policy Verification**
  - [ ] Run cross-org access tests (see SECURITY_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md)
  - [ ] Test as Owner, Admin, Contributor, Reader roles
