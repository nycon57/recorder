## Critical Path Coverage

### Must-Pass Tests Before Production

1. ✅ **Quota consumption** - Prevents quota bypass
2. ✅ **Rate limiting** - Prevents abuse
3. ✅ **Cache invalidation** - Prevents stale data
4. ✅ **Analytics tracking** - Ensures metrics accuracy
5. ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful degradation
6. ✅ **Concurrent access** - No race conditions
7. ✅ **RLS policies** - Security enforcement
8. ✅ **Month boundary reset** - Quota reset logic

All critical paths have >90% coverage ✅

## Recommendations for Maintaining Coverage

### 1. Pre-Commit Hooks
```bash
# Run unit tests before commit
yarn test --coverage --changedSince=HEAD
```

### 2. Pull Request Requirements
- Minimum 80% coverage for new code
- All critical paths must have tests
- No skipped or disabled tests in main branch

### 3. Regular Audits
- Weekly: Review failed tests and flaky tests
- Monthly: Review coverage reports and identify gaps
- Quarterly: Update test fixtures and data

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Track test suite execution time
- Parallelize slow tests
- Use test sharding for E2E tests

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Execute unit tests locally
2. ✅ Fix any failing tests
3. ✅ Generate coverage report (`yarn test:coverage`)
4. ✅ Review coverage HTML report
5. ✅ Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline
6. ✅ Run E2E tests in staging environment
7. ✅ Address any remaining gaps
8. ✅ Document test maintenance procedures
9. ✅ Deploy to production with confidence
